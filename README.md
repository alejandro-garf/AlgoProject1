# Wildlife Movement Cycle Detection - Algo 1

## Overview
This program analyzes the movement paths of animals based on recorded GPS coordinates to determine if an animal has revisited a location (i.e., formed a cycle in its movement). It uses **graph theory** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to detect cycles in the movement data.

## Features
- Accepts **n** coordinate pairs representing movement paths.
- Uses **DFS-based cycle detection** in an undirected graph.
- Outputs whether a **loop (cycle) exists** in the animalâ€™s movement.
- Runs in **O(n + m) time complexity**, making it efficient for large datasets.

## Prerequisites
To compile and run this C++ program, ensure you have:
- A **C++ compiler** (e.g., `g++` for GCC).
- A terminal or command prompt for execution.

## Installation & Compilation

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wildlife-movement-analysis.git
cd wildlife-movement-analysis
```

### **2. Compile the Program**
Using **GCC** (recommended):
```sh
g++ -o cycle_detection main.cpp
```

### **3. Run the Program**
```sh
./cycle_detection
```

---

## Usage
Upon running the program, it will prompt you to:
1. Enter the number of movement pairs.
2. Enter pairs of coordinates representing animal movements.

The program will then analyze the movement path and determine if a cycle (loop) exists.

## Test Cases

### **Test Case 1: Cycle Detected**
#### **Input:**
```
Enter the number of movement pairs: 7
Enter the movement pairs (start and end coordinates):
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 2
4 6
```
#### **Output:**
```
Loop detected
```

### **Test Case 2: No Cycle**
#### **Input:**
```
Enter the number of movement pairs: 5
Enter the movement pairs (start and end coordinates):
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```
#### **Output:**
```
No loop detected
```
