# Wildlife Movement Cycle Detection - Algo 1

## Overview
This program analyzes the movement paths of animals based on recorded GPS coordinates to determine if an animal has revisited a location (i.e., formed a cycle in its movement). It uses **graph theory** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to detect cycles in the movement data.

## Features
- Accepts **n** coordinate pairs representing movement paths.
- Uses **DFS-based cycle detection** in an undirected graph.
- Outputs whether a **loop (cycle) exists** in the animalâ€™s movement.
- Runs in **O(n + m) time complexity**, making it efficient for large datasets.

## Prerequisites
To compile and run this C++ program, ensure you have:
- A **C++ compiler** (e.g., `g++` for GCC).
- A terminal or command prompt for execution.

---

## Installation & Compilation

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wildlife-movement-analysis.git
cd wildlife-movement-analysis
```

### **2. Compile the Program**
Using **GCC** (recommended):
```sh
g++ -o cycle_detection main.cpp
```

### **3. Run the Program**
```sh
./cycle_detection
```

---

## Usage
Upon running the program, it will prompt you to:
1. Enter the number of movement pairs.
2. Enter pairs of coordinates representing animal movements.

The program will then analyze the movement path and determine if a cycle (loop) exists.

---

## Test Cases

### **Test Case 1: Cycle Detected**
#### **Input:**
```
Enter the number of movement pairs: 7
Enter the movement pairs (start and end coordinates):
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 2
4 6
```
#### **Output:**
```
Loop detected
```

### **Test Case 2: No Cycle**
#### **Input:**
```
Enter the number of movement pairs: 5
Enter the movement pairs (start and end coordinates):
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```
#### **Output:**
```

# Circular Road Trip - Algo 2 

## Overview  
This program determines the **optimal starting city** for a circular road trip where a vehicle must complete the journey without running out of fuel. It utilizes **greedy algorithms** and **fuel balance tracking** to efficiently compute the valid starting city.  

## Features  
- Accepts **n** cities with distance and fuel availability data.  
- Computes **fuel balance dynamically** to identify the optimal starting point.  
- Runs in **O(n) time complexity**, ensuring efficiency even for large datasets.  

## Prerequisites  
To compile and run this C++ program, ensure you have:  
- A **C++ compiler** (e.g., `g++` for GCC).  
- A terminal or command prompt for execution.  

---

## Installation & Compilation  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/circular-road-trip.git
cd circular-road-trip
```

### **2. Compile the Program**  
Using **GCC** (recommended):  
```sh
g++ -o find_starting_city main.cpp
```

### **3. Run the Program**  
```sh
./find_starting_city
```

---

## Usage  
Upon running the program, it will prompt you to:  
1. Enter the number of cities.  
2. Input the distances between consecutive cities.  
3. Enter the amount of fuel available at each city.  
4. Provide the miles per gallon (MPG) of the vehicle.  

The program will then compute and output the **index of the optimal starting city** for completing the full circular journey.  

---

## Test Cases  

### **Test Case 1: Optimal Start Exists**  
#### **Input:**  
```
Enter the number of cities: 5  
Enter city distances: 5 25 15 10 15  
Enter fuel available: 1 2 1 0 3  
Enter MPG: 10  
```
#### **Output:**  
```
The preferred starting city is: 4
```

### **Test Case 2: Edge Case - Minimum Fuel at Start**  
#### **Input:**  
```
Enter the number of cities: 4  
Enter city distances: 10 20 30 10  
Enter fuel available: 2 3 4 1  
Enter MPG: 10  
```
#### **Output:**  
```
The preferred starting city is: 1
```

---

## Notes  
- The solution guarantees **exactly one** valid starting city.  
- The algorithm uses **fuel balance tracking** to efficiently determine feasibility in a single pass.  
- The program ensures **modular and reusable** logic for flexible use cases.
